# CurrencyConverter
This app converts currency from a one country to another. There are currently 5 countries to choose from including: USA, UK, EU, China and Switzerland.
Traveling internationally to a strange land can be nerve wrecking, especially when trying to figure out currency conversions on the spot.
This app can be very useful for travelers, people immigranting to a different country or seeking refuge. This list of countries will expand to include
more of a seletion in the future.

To get started download the zip file for this repository and import it into your IDE. Run the application and you will be prompted with questions that
will help you calculate the conversion.
